# ü§ñ Creating SSH and registry secrets in Code Engine

> **NOTE:** This step is already fullfiled by the bootcamp speakers. Urls can be found in this document.
      

## Create SSH Key

Step 1: Open the terminal on your laptop.

      > **NOTE:** For a windows user, use the Windows Powershell application.
      
   Step 2: Run the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa`.
   
   Step 3: Press **Enter** to accept the default file path (do not change it).
   
   Step 4: Press **Enter** twice when prompted for a passphrase, as we do not need one.
   Note: This will generate two keys - a public key and a private key.

   Step 5: Copy the public key using the command: `cat /path/to/publickey | pbcopy`. Make sure you include the actual path.

      - Example: `cat /Users/akshaypatel/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy`
   
   Step 6: Open your [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.ibm.com) account on your browser, click on your profile image and then select the **Settings** option. Select "SSH and GPG Keys", or click [here](https://github.ibm.com/settings/keys).
   
   Step 7: Click the **New SSH Key** button.

   <img src="./assets/settings-ssh.png" alt="drawing" heigth="400" width="400"/>
   
   Step 8: Enter a title for the key, select "Authentication Key", and paste the public key.

   <img src="./assets/add-sshkey.png" alt="drawing" heigth="400" width="400"/>
   
   Step 9: Save the private key in a document or on a Notepad, as we will need it later.

## Create SSH and registry secrets in Code Engine

Two secrets will be required for application deployment in Code Engine:

1. Registry Secrets: these secrets will allow you to authenticate and interact with the container registry where your images will be pushed.

2. SSH Key for GitHub: this SSH key will enable access to the GitHub repository to clone the code securely.

### Steps for Creating Secrets

Step 1: On the Code Engine page, select the **Secret and configmaps** option.

   <img src="./assets/navigate-secrets.png" alt="drawing" heigth="400" width="400"/>


Step 2: Click the **Create** button.

   <img src="./assets/create-secrete.png" alt="drawing" heigth="400" width="400"/>

#### Registry Secrets 
   Step 1: Select **Registry secret** and click the **Next** button.

   <img src="./assets/registry-secret.png" alt="drawing" heigth="400" width="400"/>

   Step 2: Add a secret name.

   Step 3: Paste the **API KEY**.

   Step 4: Click the **Create** button.

   <img src="./assets/registerySecret.png" alt="drawing" heigth="400" width="400"/>
      
### SSH Secrets for GitHub

Now you will create an SSH secret for GitHub using the steps below.

   Step 1: Select SSH secret.

   Step 2: Click the **Next** button.

   <img src="./assets/github-secret.png" alt="drawing" heigth="400" width="400"/>

   Step 3: Add a secret name.

   Step 4: Copy the private key from this command `cat [privatekey/path] | pbcopy`. Make sure you include the actual path.
      - Example `cat /Users/akshaypatel/.ssh/id_rsa | pbcopy`

   Step 5: Click the **Create** button.

# Ask HR ‚Äì Backend App Deployment Details  

‚öôÔ∏è This use case simulates interactions with an HR system or database, allowing to update employee information or request time off. The following instructions show you how to set this up.

## Deployment Information  
- The backend service for the HR application is implemented using **FastAPI** and should be deployed on **IBM Code Engine** and the build image is should be created in **IBM Container Registry**. You can find the backend script in code engine [here](/usecase-setup/askhr/HCM_APP/prof_mgmt.py)
  
## API Documentation  
- The **OpenAPI specification ([hr.yaml](/usecase-setup/askhr/HCM_APP/hr.yaml))** provides API details that can be imported as tools into an agent in **watsonx Orchestrate**.

## Default app data
- The HCM Application has a set of pre-defined user details. Request the **instructor to share one user name with each of the bootcamp participants** & ask them to use that name for their transactions.

**Note**: Using names outside this will result in errors or exceptions.

# App deployment Guide:
## Reserving the techzone instance

Reserve the techzone instance that includes watsonx.ai, watsonx orchestrate, IBM code engine and Container Registry. 
You can reserve it using this [link](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/client-engineering-agentic-ai-labs/journey-instructor-environments) For instructor setup make sure to reserve a single environment.

## Code Engine Deployment
1. Navigate to IBM Cloud.

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image0.1.png">

2. Click on the hamburger menu in the top left and then select **Resource List**.

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image0.2.png">

3 This will show you a list of available resources in your instance. Select **Containers**, which will give you a list of products. Choose the **Code Engine** product.

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image0.3.png">

4. This is homepage of code engine.
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image1.png">

5. From menu, click on "Applications", then click on "Create".
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image2.png">

6. Give your application a name. Select "Build container image from source code" under Code section. Paste "git@github.ibm.com:skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp-instructors.git" in "Code repo URL" field.
Then click on "Specify build details"
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image3.png">


6.1.  For later steps you'll be needing an SSH secret key and Registry secret.
      Follow this
      [Guide](/environment-setup/common/Readme.md). If you          already have an SSH secret and registry secret, you can skip.

7. In "SSH secret" field, you have to select your ssh secret to access Github Repo. In "Branch name" field, type "main".
In "Context directory" field, put "usecase-setup/askhr/HCM_APP". Finally click on "Next".
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image4.png">

8. In next step, select Strategy "Dockerfile", keep Timeout "40m". In "Build resources", select "M(1 vCPU / 4 GB)" from dropdown. Then click on "Next"
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image5.png">

9. Select available registry server from dropdown in "Registry Server" field, In "Registry secret" field, select your registry secret. "Namespace" field will be automatically filled, otherwise you can select one from dropdown. 
Give your Repository (image) a name, in "Tag" section, type "latest". Finally click on "Done".
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image6.png">

10. Scroll down a bit. Increase "Min number of instances" by 1. 
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="/usecase-setup/environment-setup/assets/code_engine_setup/image7.png">

11. Select "Public" in Domain mappings.
